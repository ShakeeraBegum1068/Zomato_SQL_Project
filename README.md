# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India.
The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

- ## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```
###  Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

### Creating Tables
create table customers(
	customer_id int primary key,
	customer_name varchar(25) not null,
	reg_date date
	
);

create table restaurants(
	restaurant_id int primary key,
	restaurant_name varchar(55),
	city varchar(25),
	opening_hours varchar(55)
);

create table riders(
	rider_id int primary key,
	rider_name varchar(55),
	sign_up date
);

create table orders(
	order_id int primary key,
	customer_id int,
	restaurant_id int,
	order_item varchar(55).
	order_date date,
	order_time time,
	order_status varchar(25),
	total_amount numeric,
	foreign key (customer_id) references customers(customer_id),
	foreign key (restaurant_id) references restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

create table deliveries(
	delivery_id int primary key,
	order_id int,
	delivery_status varchar(35),
	delivery_time time,
	rider_id int,
	foreign Key (order_id) references orders(order_id),
	foreign key (rider_id) references riders(rider_id
);

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

select count(*) from customers
where 
	customer_name is null
	or
	reg_date is null

select count(*) from restaurants
where
	restaurant_name is null
	or 
	city is null
	or 
	opening_hours is null

select * from orders
where 
	order_item is null
	or
	order_date is null
	or 
	order_time is null
	or
	order_status is null
	or 
	total_amount is null

select count(*) from riders
where
	rider_name is null
	or 
	sign_up is null

select count(*) from riders
where
	order_id is null
	or
	delivery_status


Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary.
For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems Solved

### Top 5 Most Frequently Ordered Dishes
### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.
```sql
with ranking_cte as(
select
	c.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,
	o.order_item,
	count(o.order_item) as total_orders,
	dense_rank() over(order by count(o.order_item) desc) as rn
from orders as o 
join customers as c 
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
where c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta' and order_date between '2023-09-02' and '2024-09-02'
group by 1,2,3
order by 4 desc)
select
	customer_id,
	customer_name,
	order_item,
	total_orders
from ranking_cte
where rn <= 5
```
### Popular Time Slots
### 2. Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed, based on 2-hour intervals



```sql
-- Approach 1
select 
	case
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 0 and 1 then   '00:00 - 02:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 2 and 3 then   '02:00- 04:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 4 and 5 then   '04:00 - 06:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 6 and 7 then   '06:00 - 08:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 8 and 9 then   '08:00 - 10:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 10 and 11 then '10:00 - 12:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 12 and 13 then '12:00 - 14:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 14 and 15 then '14:00 - 16:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 16 and 17 then '16:00 - 18:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 18 and 19 then '18:00 - 20:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 20 and 21 then '20:00 - 22:00'
	when extract(hour from order_time) between 22 and 23 then '22:00 - 24:00'
	end as time_slot,
	count(order_id) as order_count
from orders
group by time_slot
order by order_count desc
```

```sql
-- Approach 2

select
	floor(extract(hour from order_time)/2)*2  as start_time,
	floor(extract(hour from order_time/2))*2 + 2 as end_time,
	count(order_id) as order_count
from orders
group by start_time, end_time
order by order_count desc
```

### Order Value Analysis
### Q.3 Find the average order value (AOV) per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return: customer_name, aov (average order value).

```sql
select
	c.customer_name,
	avg(o.total_amount) as aov
from orders as o 
join customers as c 
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
group by c.customer_name
having count(o.order_id) > 750
```

### High-Value Customers

### Q.4 List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- Return: customer_name, customer_id.

```sql
select
	c.customer_name,
	c.customer_id

having sum(total_amount) > 100000
```

### Orders Without Delivery

## Conclusion

This project highlights my ability to handle complex SQL queries and provides solutions to real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery service like Zomato.
The approach taken here demonstrates a structured problem-solving methodology, data manipulation skills, and the ability to derive actionable insights from data.

## Notice 

All customer names and data used in this project are computer-generated using AI and random functions.
They do not represent real data associated with Zomato or any other entity. This project is solely for learning and educational purposes, and any resemblance to actual persons, businesses, or events is purely coincidental.
